Definations

Convolution: It is an operation performed on the image to get a new image.

Filters/Kernels: Something which extracts features from matrix.

Epochs: Number of times the machine model is trained.

1x1 Convolution: It is a convulation of size 11 which would convolve nn into 1*1.

3x3 Convolution: It is a convulation of size 33 which would convolve nn into 3*3.

Feature Maps:It is result of convolutiona applied to a particular matrix.

Activation Function: Something which verifies if the obtained feature map is correct or wrong.

Receptive Field: Part of image specifically where a convolution is looking.
